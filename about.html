		We believe beauty service is no different than health care service. While working in nail salons to put myself through dental school, I thought to myself there has to be a better way. Clients don't want to be overwhelmed with toxic smells, and materials, and uncleanliness, all while waiting in a boring atmosphere.&nbsp;<br /><br />We pride ourselves by utilizing the highest quality ingredients and providing world-class services that encompass an elevated, honest and non-toxic experience throughout every facet of nail care, waxing and lashes.<br /><br />Growing up in a 3rd world country was difficult, but when I look back on those struggles, I realize that those are the things that made me who I am today. Supporting women in my business to become leaders and supporting women in the community is my way of saying thank you to Charlotte for giving me my freedom and the ability to follow my dreams.<br /><br /><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Articles</strong><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/charlottefive/c5-around-town/article236109113.html?fbclid=IwAR2uBNVNsnPBiHu9rnXgpB46C5k-Fi56iCpwnw9u1C61QbuKCJPGjfX6zs4">CharlotteFive Founder</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcnc.com/amp/article/features/noda-nail-salon-honors-charlotte-girl-who-recently-died-of-cancer/275-7560a585-ca01-4238-8a65-5aa65466bf53?fbclid=IwAR12NdfrZfcc--oW-sewV3g5jKOJmVPJzThIDDgtPOtm9K2_6PU3LQOtdHw">Mani's for Madison WCNC</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/charlottefive/c5-things-to-do/article241172141.html?fbclid=IwAR3b147wXI4S0CbTjF428lRlBk1NT7Sh3WxanpCaqBtz7kFxw_7wwnfps2k">How to Support During Social Distancing</a>&nbsp;WCNC<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/charlotte-businesses-closing-due-to-covid-19/275-dfd08376-f4d6-464f-99ab-c831dc993b80?fbclid=IwAR2BKlJC6OF6DUS5yDDx7Pxx4gL0jnkwXSQNu1bTm9uWklahg63FaCC-ZZk">COVID-19 Closure WCNC</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wccbcharlotte.com/2020/05/19/charlotte-nail-bar-implementing-new-safety-guidelines-for-customers-workers-ahead-of-phase-2-reopening/?fbclid=IwAR1TTdRjgkXhjZCso39aKfLOMw3NaLTIjmIoIKrNdqxPHLU2jKqtIB945Ko">Safety Procedures</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wccbcharlotte.com/2020/05/19/charlotte-nail-bar-implementing-new-safety-guidelines-for-customers-workers-ahead-of-phase-2-reopening/?fbclid=IwAR1TTdRjgkXhjZCso39aKfLOMw3NaLTIjmIoIKrNdqxPHLU2jKqtIB945Ko">&nbsp;WCCB</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/money/business/some-businesses-prepare-to-reopen-others-disappointed-to-be-left-out/275-b76e5883-cc04-4c98-a2a1-ef133a81a149?fbclid=IwAR1J9YoEef9oJKhxRxCZkQl-oUawWXQJvwfrP3e4nZ2culDu9V17NBDpsvg">Safety Opening WCNC</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wbtv.com/2020/05/21/how-personal-care-services-like-waxing-nail-bars-are-trying-reopen-safely-friday/?outputType=amp&amp;fbclid=IwAR1yOi2HQnQnMDET_NTSWUkWxoThjR23wo7XTD3mRkAQpuBEWNZjrbJ2oY0">Safety Opening WBTV&nbsp;</a><br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Mimosas difference in these unprecedented times to keep you safe. </strong><br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe beauty service is no different than health care service.&nbsp;</em><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Equipment:</strong><br />-<strong>Ventilation:</strong> First and one of a only few salons in North Carolina with world-class ventilation at each and every station that produces fresh air into clients&rsquo; personal space rather than circulating the existing air in the salon.&nbsp;<br />-<strong>Sanitization:</strong> Constant and consistent sanitation with hospital-grade disinfectant along with use of UV-C light sterilization wands.<br />-<strong>Clean Lab:</strong> Mimosas existing &ldquo;Clean Lab&rdquo; sterilization standards will continue and will be increased.
