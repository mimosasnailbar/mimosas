			LET'S BE TOGETHER SOON<br /><br />Thank you sincerely, Charlotte neighbors, for your support with open arms from day one of us putting up our &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; sign. We are currently closed due to COVID19 and are planning on opening back up April 30th.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We have automatically froze all accounts until we open again. If your account was billed while we were closed, your member's manicure will be rolled over and can be used anytime when we are open again or you can request a refund (themimosasnailbar@gmail.com).<br />&nbsp;<br />I wanted to also share that our existence is because of you and I am overwhelmed with the wonderful support emails and other communications on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook we have received from our wonderful members in the past few days that I can never forget or appreciate you enough. While social distancing is an important part of our responsibility to help end the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19), it's having adverse effects on small businesses, like ours. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Our small business supports our family and our beautiful technicians support their families by your amazing patronage.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We may be separated but our hearts stay together<br />&nbsp;<br />Trang
